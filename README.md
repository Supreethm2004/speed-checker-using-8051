## Working Principle  
1. **Object Detection:** Two IR sensors are placed at a fixed distance apart along the path of the moving object. These sensors detect when the object passes through their respective points.  
2. **Time Measurement:** The microcontroller records the time taken by the object to travel between the two sensors.  
3. **Speed Calculation:** Using the formula:  

   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
   \]  
   where distance is the fixed distance between the two sensors.  

4. **Output Display:** The calculated speed is displayed on a 16x2 LCD in real time.  
5. **Overspeed Alert:** If the calculated speed exceeds a predefined threshold, the buzzer sounds to indicate overspeeding.
